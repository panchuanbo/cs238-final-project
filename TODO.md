## TODO
* Someone sould audit `ai.py` to make sure it's actually collecting (s, a, r, sp) tuples correctly
* Experiment with SARSA
* Implement online methods and the corresponding rules for making that possible
* Experiment with other networks, potentially
* Explore heuristics and learning heuristics for online methods

## Cool Things
* AlphaZero would be cool, but not sure if feasible :)
